# Spotify-Data-Analytics

In today’s digital music era, platforms like Spotify generate massive amounts of data related to songs, artists, genres, and user preferences. However, this raw data often lacks clarity and is difficult to interpret without proper analysis. Music lovers, artists, and researchers struggle to gain meaningful insights such as:
Which genres dominate across different decades?
What audio features (danceability, energy, valence, etc.) define popular songs?
How do trends in music evolve over time?
What patterns can be identified in artist popularity and song characteristics?
This project aims to analyze and visualize Spotify’s dataset to uncover hidden trends, patterns, and insights in the music industry.
